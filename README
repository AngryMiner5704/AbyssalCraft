If you happen to find any code that's not working correctly, report it here. Feel free to contribute to the mod as well.
The issue tracker is available here, so report any bugs you find, and I'll be sure to squash them.

If you are looking into developing AbyssalCraft Add-ons (eventhough the API isn't complete), or just want to integrate
it into your mod, check the "dev" branch for compiled mod jars that can be imported into your workspace.
