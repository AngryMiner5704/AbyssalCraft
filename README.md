### Reporting bugs

If you happen to find a bug while playing with the mod, report an issue, with a detailed explanation of what triggered the possible crash (or the bug), and the crash report (either as a gist or a site like pastebin). If you can track down a bug directly in the code, file a pull request pointing out the incorrect code while providing a fix. Make sure you label the issue with the "bug" label (does not apply for a direct PR).

### Suggestions/Enhancements

If you find something you think I should change in the mod that can enhance the experience for you and other users, make an issue and use the "enhancement" label on it. If you, on the other hand, have a suggestion, use the "suggestion" label instead. In both cases, be detailed about the enhancement/suggestion. I have a little list here of things that I need suggestions and feedback on, so if you're up for that, check it out: http://pastebin.com/5asBefVV

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Most contributions might end up being tweaks and improvements, but that's still a contribution.

### Integrations

If you are looking into developing AbyssalCraft Add-ons (eventhough the API isn't complete), or just want to integrate
it into your mod, check the "dev" branch for compiled mod jars that can be imported into your workspace. It is, of course, also possible to only use the API by itself, in which case you can download the API alone from the "dev" branch, then just extract the contents of the zip file into src/api/java.
