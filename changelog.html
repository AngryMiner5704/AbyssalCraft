	<li>Lesser Shoggoths now ignore Zombie Villagers</li>
	<li>If any of the "Shoggoth Lair Generation Chance" options are set to 0, lairs won't generate in those areas, instead of causing a crash</li>
	<li>The textures for the Dark Offspring have been tweaked to look a bit more spooky and goatish</li>
	<li>Started preliminary work on optimizing worldgen features (trees, structures etc). Might not have a noticeable effect, but it's better than it was before</li>
	<li>Swapped the texts on the pages for the Decorative Shub-Niggurath and Yog-Sothoth Statues</li>
