<ul>
	<li>Custom NBT added through a summoning ritual will now work for all properties that can be changed through NBT (instead of only mob-specific properties)</li>
	<li>Fuzzy NBT checking is now handled properly (if Item Stack A has no NBT, but Item Stack B does, they will be equal as B "contains" A)</li>
</ul>
