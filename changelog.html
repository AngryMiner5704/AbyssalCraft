<ul>
	<li>A bunch of textures have been revamped (courtesy of Dylan4ever)</li>
	<li>Lesser Shoggoths can no longer break Bedrock (or other unbreakable blocks) with their acid</li>
	<li>Acid Projectiles no longer break blocks with Tile Entities when hitting Players or other mobs</li>
	<li>Scaled down the model of the baby Lesser Shoggoth (to be more proportional with the hitbox, also made the eyes a bit bigger)</li>
	<li>Slowed down the initial velocity of the Acid Projectile, increased the time between each projectile being fired, and made it so baby Lesser Shoggoths won't fire them</li>
	<li>Added a config option for changing the frequency at which Lesser Shoggoths spit acid</li>
	<li>J'zahar now respects the mobGriefing gamerule with his explosion</li>
	<li>Fixed a dupe bug in the Materializer GUI</li>
	<li>Mobs spawned through a summoning ritual now have their portal cooldown set to max</li>
	<li>Increased the time it takes for a Greater Dread Spawn and Lesser Dreadbeast to spawn a regular Dread Spawn</li>
	<li>Increased the time it takes for Cha'garoth to spawn the various things he spawns, and removed the direct physical damage dealt by his fireballs</li>
	<li>Reduced the range of Cha'garoth's melee attacks</li>
	<li>Fixed the pick block for Calcified Stone</li>
