	<li>If Liquid Coralium flows into the ocean while "Oceanic Coralium Pollution" is disabled, infinite blocks of Cobblestone no longer drops in the water</li>
	<li>Optimized the Transmutator and Crystallizer (probably barely noticable, but its processing is handled more efficiently internally)</li>

	<li>Fixed numerous instances of sentences using the wrong indefinite article in the en_us lang file (courtesy of mcBegins2Snow)</li>
	<li>Crafting recipes for Darklands Oak Fence and Dreadlands Fence are no longer overriden by vanilla (Darklands Oak Button and Pressure Plates are still, however)</li>
