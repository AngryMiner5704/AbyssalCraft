necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon.1=This is the Abyssalnomicon, a book written by J'zahar, Gatekeeper of The Abyss. The book contains the knowledge of the 4 Necronomicons, as they are in fact chapters of this book. There is also extensive knowledge not mentioned in the others.
necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon.2=As the knowledge about spells and rituals is limited to the specified dimension (and previous ones, depending on the Necronomicon type), the Abyssalnomcion has all knowledge collected in one place, with additions.

necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.1=AbyssalCraft is the mod which this book was designed for. It mainly focuses on exploration with the additions of 3 dimensions, all filled with new materials and new monsters to face (who drops new loot). There are also new machines added to the mod.
necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.2=They allow the player to bend the elements of nature more than they could before. These include the Crystallizer, the Transmutator and the Engraver (which doesn't bend the elements of nature, as it is used to engrave coins).

necronomicon.text.yog-sothoth.1=Yog-Sothoth, The Lurker at the Threshold, is an Outer God, and the offspring of the Nameless Mist.
necronomicon.text.yog-sothoth.2=It is heavily implied, if not outright stated, that Yog-Sothoth is omniscient, and is locked outside the universe, meaning he knows and can see all of space-time all at once, that there is no secret hidden from Yog-Sothoth.
necronomicon.text.shub-niggurath.1=Shub-Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, is an Outer God in the pantheon.
necronomicon.text.shub-niggurath.2=She is a perverse fertility deity, said to appear as an enormous cloudy mass which extrudes black tentacles, slime-dripping mouths, and short, writhing goat legs. Small creatures are continually spat forth by the monstrosity, which are reconsumed or escape

necronomicon.text.jzahar.2=Having a desire for power, and not wanting exile to the stars, J'zahar reached out beyond time and space to achieve his freedom. The results were similar powers to that of Yog-Sothoth, and the punishment of eternally guarding his imprisoned fellow deities.

necronomicon.text.greatoldones=Before the ages of man, the universe was ruled by a race of ancient demonic gods known as "The Great Old ones". Due to a conflict aeons ago, all of these beings are imprisoned far away where no man has ever set foot.

necronomicon.text.dreadlands=Previously a world of Abyssalnite, the Dreadlands got it's name when the Dread Plague was unleashed on it, killing all miners and corrupting the peaceful Abyssalnite Golems. The second layer of the Abyss holds lost souls of the living.
necronomicon.text.omothol=A endless temple city built at the very edge of sanity. The Realm of J'zahar holds the only entrance to where The Great Old Ones dwell. The Gatekeeper is always watching, and nobody leaves the final layer of the Abyss alive.
