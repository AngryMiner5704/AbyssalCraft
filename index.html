<h1>Welcome to my little page here!</h1>

<p><strong>AbyssalCraft</strong> is a mod centered around exploration, but with a growing magic influence. Another thing that has been getting more focus is influences from the works of <strong>H.P Lovecraft</strong>, adding even more evil to that which is already in the mod.
Enough about that, let's dig into the mod! The first thing you need in order to get started is a Necronomicon, crafted like in the picture below:<br>
<img src="../AbyssalCraft/images/necronomicon_crafting.png" alt="Necronomicon Crafting"><br>
Most (if not all) information about things from the mod can be found in the Necronomicon. Apart from being a guide book to the mod, the Necronomicon is also serves as a catalyst for performing rituals.<br>
Going in a bit more on the mod, AbyssalCraft features a collection of dimensions known as <i>The Abyss</i> (the world of the dead, split into several layers, where each layer is a dimension). The dimensions (4 in total, whereas the fourth is a bit of an extension to the third) are:

<ul>
<li><strong>The Abyssal Wasteland</strong> (quite green, inhabited by various undead beings, among them the vanilla zombies and skeletons, then new mobs added in the mod).</li>
<li><strong>The Dreadlands</strong> (red, a place crawling with nameless mutated beings that may or may not have been a normal creature sometime in the past).</li>
<li><strong>Omothol</strong> (the realm of J'zahar, a dimension consisting of floating islands with a city built upon them, this is where you encounter the final boss).</li>
<li><strong>The Dark Realm</strong> (dark place beneath Omothol, populated by living shadows).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><img src="../AbyssalCraft/images/abyssalcraft_1.png" alt="Dimensions"><br>
In order to reach the various dimensions, one must obtain Gateway Keys (items capable of placing down portals when used).<br>
<img src="../AbyssalCraft/images/abyssalcraft_2.png" alt="Gateway Keys"><br>
Apart from traveling between dimensions, there's also a pitch of magic, in the form of rituals consisting of an altar and pedestals which you place offerings on. There's several different types of rituals, among them rituals where you create items,
rituals where you infuse items (turn one item into a different, or simply "upgrade" the item). There's also rituals where you can summon things (the first boss is summoned through such a ritual), and rituals where you can inflict potion effects on nearby entities.
If you want to create your own type of ritual, there's an API for that, and if you simply want to add your own creation/infusion ritual, that can either be done through the API, or with MineTweaker (the add-on mod <a href="https://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/234851-abyssalcraft-integration">AbyssalCraft Integration</a> has MineTweaker compatibility).<br>
<img src="../AbyssalCraft/images/abyssalcraft_5.png" alt="Rituals"><br>
In addition to the rituals, there's also a new form of energy used in order to perform the rituals. This energy is called Potential Energy, and can be obtained through a few methods (this is being expanded).<br>
Along with all of this is also a lot of new blocks (among them 5 new types of stone, 15 new ores, 2 new types of trees), new items (among them 4 new materials to make tools and armor from, 8 new armor sets, a bunch of new food items).<br>
<img src="../AbyssalCraft/images/abyssalcraft_4.png" alt="Stones/Ores"><br>
Enough about quantities of things, the Overworld has also received new content, including 6 new biomes:

<ul>
<li>The Darklands (more "evil" version of a forest/plains blend, purple/indigo grass, contains Darkstone and a new type of tree, Abyssalnite can be found here)</li>
<li>Darklands Plains (plains version of the Darklands biome, has close to no trees)</li>
<li>Darklands Forest (forest version of the Darklands biome, has a lot more trees)</li>
<li>Darklands Highland (extreme hills version of the Darklands biome, more elevated terrain, not that many trees)</li>
<li>Darklands Mountains (mountains composed of Darkstone)</li>
<li>Coralium Infested Swamp (a teal/turquoise swamp, has Liquid Antimatter underground, along with the large quantity of Coralium, which is more common here than in ordinary swamps or other water-based biomes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><img src="../AbyssalCraft/images/abyssalcraft_3.png" alt="Biomes"><br>
Since I haven't mentioned the mobs, let me go over a few of them. There's the <strong>Depths Ghoul</strong> and <strong>Abyssal Zombie</strong>(both undead, found in Darklands biomes, swamps, or very commonly in the Abyssal Wasteland), <strong>evil counterparts</strong> 
of vanilla animals (Pigs, Cows, Chickens), <strong>Living Shadows</strong> (Shadow Creature/Monster/Beast, each one stronger than the former), and <strong>Lesser Shoggoths</strong> (if you're familiar with the works of H.P Lovecraft, these are smaller versions of those amorphous horrors).
That's all the mobs found in the <strong>Overworld</strong>, whereas some can be found in the dimensions.<br>

<p>This should cover most of the mod, the rest is up to you to discover (or you could just read about the majority of it in the Necronomicon). It should be noted that this is a <strong>Forge Mod</strong>, and requires <strong>Minecraft Forge</strong> to run.</p>

<p>If you want to download the mod, click on any of the links below (apart from the wiki, as that is a wiki, and not a mod thread).
  If you're here for the source code, there should be a button somewhere on the page (I think the top right) that will lead you there.</p>
  <p>However, if you're interested in developing Add-ons (or just integrate my stuff into your mod), be sure to check the instructions for setting up
  the build.gradle maven stuff in the GitHub repo README (alternatively, you can find a standalone API distro either in the extra files for relases on CurseForge or in the maven repo).

<p>The mod can be found at

<a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/145-forge-abyssalcraft-v102/">Planet Minecraft</a> and
<a href="http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/abyssalcraft">Curse</a>. There's also a <a href="http://abyssalcraft.wikia.com/wiki/AbyssalCraft_Wiki">Wiki</a>
(which will probably always need pages for new content added, or just updates on old pages), check it out for the information currently available there!

<h3>Official Add-ons</h3>

<p>In order to enable more content, there's also (currently) 2 add-ons for AbyssalCraft that can expand the usage for the mod.</p>
<p>The first mod (entitled "AbyssalCraft Heads"), found below this text, is a utility for adventure/RPG themed modpacks, providing guidance in terms of AbyssalCraft mobs, providivng you with head icons that can be used for HQM quests involving mob killing, among things.</p>
<iframe src="https://widget.mcf.li/mc-mods/minecraft/229609-abyssalcraft-heads" width="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
<p>The second mod (entitled "AbyssalCraft Integration"), is a separate module for cross-mod integrations, combinding parts of AbyssalCraft with other mods, expanding the amount of things you can do (this can also be useful in modpacks, especially ones that use MineTweaker, but also for packs that has any of the integrated mods overall).</p>
