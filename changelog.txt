- Rituals can now be performed even if there isn't enough PE (in which case the ritual will fail to complete)
- Fixed server crashes related to Fireball rain Disruptions (had code that only ran client-side)
- Somewhat fixed the hitbox issues with Lesser Shoggoths and Cha'garoth (reduced the bounding box width to 2 on both of them, makes it possible to land a hit)
- Now runs on Forge 10.13.4.1558
