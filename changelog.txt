-Added entity mappings for all entities (they can now be spawned through mob spawners, any existing entity will despawn when a world is loaded with this version)
-Replaced the Zombie spawner in the Abyssal Stronghold with a Dread Spawn Spawner
-Fixed a minor bug in the slab blocks
-Fixed a minor glitch in the Gateway Keys
-Improved the anger system for Remnants (whatever attacks one of them becomes the target for all of them, and a Minion of The Gatekeeper can tell them what to attack)
-Nerfed the ChestGenHook treasure (Dreadium Ingot no longer appear, and Refined Coralium and Abyssalnite Ingots have both been reduced the amount that can appear)
