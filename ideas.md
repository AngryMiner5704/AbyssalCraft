# Ideas
I have a private file in which I write down my thoughts on things, so generally an "idea sheet". This page is essentially a public version of that, where I write down ideas to share publically.

### The List
(note: I posted this as a pastebin on my twitter some time ago, and it's still that exact list)
 * Spells, generally have spell pages you find/create, then perhaps add them to the Necronomicon to gain access to said spell.
 * Add a villager that sells AbyssalCraft items (will need some ideas on generic stuff they could sell).
 * Create genetic material from Shoggoth Flesh by planting it and letting the "flesh crop" grow. Maybe then use a certain quantity of that flesh to create your own Lesser Shoggoths.
 * Rituals, there's a short supply of them. If I could get a pile of suggestions for that, that'll be great.
 * Crystals, I need to do a ton of re-balancing there as well, currently thinking about adding smaller and bigger crystals, so that you get the small crystals when crystallizing certain materials, then combine those into regular crystals. This could get tricky with the Materializer once it's ready for use. The big crystals (probably clusters) could perhaps be blocks that you can place on the ground (maybe then have some effect from doing that, or use them for something specific).
 * Structures in the dimensions, this is the part when spontaneous ideas for structures comes in. Omothol will look a certain way, so no suggestions for that dimension will be taken.
 * More ways to obtain Shadow Gems (generally to prevent forced grinding, or to reduce the need for grinding).
 * More ways to use materials already present in the mod (like the different types of flesh etc).

If you have any input on these things, file an issue where you elaborate on your idea/suggestion, and we'll go from there.
